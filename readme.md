# wallotto-server

wallotto-server is the api project to manage expense transaction data (and much more in the future, who know).
wallotto-server is born with [wallota-client](https://github.com/alessandramoretti/wallotta-client), an angular mobile-first website to handle all the ui needed to utilize wallotto-server.

The project consist of an architecture layer(s) and the web project.

## Why wallotto-server

I'm a meticoluos person, that likes programming and finance and I want to know where my money goes. Not satisfied with other application I've tried, I decided trying to make one myself.
